#The Local Tavern

Welcome to ‘The Local Tavern,’ where you can gather your party and venture forth to gold and glory. The Local Tavern is a tabletop game finder and organizer. It’s main objective is to link players, dungeon or game masters, and games together easily and accessibly.

I integrated the Google Maps API and geocoding to show users a map of games being held near their present location. Games are also searchable by name, DM name, game type, frequency and day of the week with the advanced search function. On each game page, a wealth of resources are available to users including a message forum, an area for game-specific notes, and sharable character sheets live updated with React so that players can share changes with their DM in real time. I integrated a dice roller with multiplayer functionality so that all the players of the game can roll dice together as well as an embedded Soundcloud player to allow for theme music to be played during sessions. Additionally, I have  created a user-to-user private messaging system.
